Here is what im thinking for my final project.
I am thinking aboout doing something related to criminal justice and
incarceration rates across the United States. I have found data that shows 
the amount of incarcerated individuals in each state, and is then broken down 
into what crimes they have committed. I have also found Covid-19 related 
stats to cases in prisons that I could incorporate into my final project 
to possibly show the effect of the pandemic on how prisons run. Below are links
to data I have found that can help with my project.
